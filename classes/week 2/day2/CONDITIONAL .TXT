 */

for loop:- The initialization, condition, and iteration statements are written at the beginning of the loop.
syntax: - 
for(initialization; condition; iteration){
   //body of the 'for' loop
}

while loop: -The initialization and the condition checking are done at the beginning of the loop.
syntax -
while ( condition) {
   statements;
   //body of the loop
}

do...while loop:- The controlling condition is present at the end of the loop.
And the condition is executed at least once even if the condition computes to false during the first iteration.
// It is also known as an exit-controlled loop
There is a condition at the end of the loop.

syntax:-
do {
   statements;
   // body of the loop.
}
while( Condition );

switch case:- In the switch statement, we compare the condition value with multiple cases. When there is a match with any one of the cases, the block of code corresponding with that case is executed. 
syntax: -
switch(expression){  
case value1:  
 //code to be executed;  
 break;  
case value2:  
 //code to be executed;  
 break;  
......  
  
default:   
 //code to be executed if the above values are not matched;  
}  

if-else:- The if-else statements execute the block of code when a specified condition is true if the condition is false another block of code can be executed.
syntax:-
if (condition) {
    // Block of code if condition true
} else {
    // Block of code is condition false
}

==>break keyword;- The break statement "jumps out" of a loop. i.e. It stops the execution.

==>continue keyword:- The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop. i.e.It skips the statement .
--> happy flow and edge cases.
