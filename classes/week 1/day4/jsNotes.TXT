=> ........DOM (Document Object Model)...=>representation of page as document 

=>  It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document.
=>  We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
=> The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.
=>   using DOM  helps javascript to change  element on a webpage dynamically 
-->   i.e without having changes

===>    js is also object oriented but not a class based object oriented language like java.

    * js runs in browser and can be disabled
    * not all browsers will suport all js funtions-though rare
    *javascript and java are tottaly different -no relation
    *js code is placed in head section 
         -else what if body makes a call to your js before the script is loded

// ....     Each object will have a bunch of attributes or variables(and values)
// ....     associated it..
